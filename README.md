## What is Science Hub?

**Science Hub** is a modular, offline science platform built for learning, experimenting, researching, visualizing, and organizing scientific concepts on your computer, with dedicated tools, a fully local AI assistant, and complete data integration.

You can simulate phenomena, solve problems in physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and math, save results, organize formulas, manage scientific images, and search for articles—all in a single system designed to let you explore science your way.

## Main Features

- **Science Library:** Register, search, and filter your own formulas, concepts, descriptions, images, and tags. Create your personal science encyclopedia, with batch export/import and smart linking.
- **Results Gallery:** Manage, view, and organize images, charts, experiment outputs, and results, all with favorites, tags, and automatic metadata.
- **Molecular Search:** Find compounds using PubChem, view structures, formulas, and detailed data.
- **Academic Search:** Find scientific articles directly via OpenAlex, including title, authors, DOI, abstract, and open-access links.
- **Local AI Assistant:** A true science assistant running offline via Ollama, with multiple models and modes (explanation, direct answer, or casual conversation).
- **Full Integration:** All tools, results, and references are connected—save, share, export, and retrieve your discoveries with ease.
- **Modern Interface:** A few windows use PyQt6, with a dark theme, Unicode-safe rendering, and smart search and filters.
