  "about": {
    "project_name": "Science Hub",
    "creator": "Pablo Oeffner Ferreira",
    "origin": "Science Hub was started by Pablo Oeffner Ferreira at age 14. The first tool was a terminal velocity and fall time calculator. What began as a simple physics calculator grew into a full-featured, modular desktop environment for science, built in Python with PyQt6. Its core purpose is to unify scientific learning, experimentation, visualization, and tooling—all in one offline app.",
    "goals": [
      "Be a practical alternative to school-style learning by enabling real scientific exploration.",
      "Encourage curiosity across all scientific fields, not just one subject.",
      "Respect user control: no cloud, no API keys, no telemetry.",
      "Provide a tool-rich lab interface that adapts to different disciplines and workflows."
    ],
    "design_principles": [
      "Offline-first: all features work locally, even the AI assistant.",
      "Modular and extensible: users can add tools as simple Python scripts.",
      "Cross-discipline: integrates chemistry, biology, math, physics, and geology.",
      "Personalized: includes an AI assistant aware of all built-in tools.",
      "Minimal overhead: fast to load, simple to maintain, and system-friendly."
    ],
    "features": [
      "Science Library: create and link concepts, formulas, and notes.",
      "Gallery: manage scientific diagrams, experiment photos, and plots with tags and metadata.",
      "Tool Launcher: quick access to modular tools (calculators, solvers, visualizers).",
      "Result Storage: save and attach outputs to experiments or library entries.",
      "AI Assistant: runs fully offline with Ollama, aware of all Science Hub tools.",
      "Model Tooltips: users can hover over each AI model to learn its strengths.",
      "Batch Import/Export: migrate or back up entire libraries and galleries.",
      "Markdown rendering in chat, emoji-free output, and a clean, local GUI."
