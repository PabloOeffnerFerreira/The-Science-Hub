  "description": "The DNA double helix is the molecular structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, consisting of two strands coiled around each other. Each strand is composed of nucleotides with a sugar-phosphate backbone and nitrogenous bases. Base pairing (A-T and G-C) holds the strands together, storing genetic information for organisms.",
