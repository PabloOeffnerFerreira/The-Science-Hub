  "description": "Glucose is a simple sugar and one of the most important carbohydrates in biology. It serves as a primary source of energy for cells in most organisms. Produced by photosynthesis and consumed in cellular respiration, glucose is crucial in both plant and animal life. In the human body, it's transported in the blood and regulated by insulin. Its oxidation through glycolysis and the citric acid cycle yields ATP, the cell's energy currency.",
