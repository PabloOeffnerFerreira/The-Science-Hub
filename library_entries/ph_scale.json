  "description": "The pH scale measures the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. It ranges from 0 (highly acidic) to 14 (highly basic), with 7 being neutral. A change of one pH unit corresponds to a tenfold change in hydrogen ion concentration. The scale is logarithmic and plays a central role in chemistry, biology, and environmental science.",
