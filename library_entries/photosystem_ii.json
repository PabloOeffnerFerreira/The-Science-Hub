  "description": "Photosystem II is a protein-pigment complex in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. It captures light energy to split water molecules into oxygen, protons, and electrons. This is the first step in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. The released electrons are passed down an electron transport chain, powering ATP formation.",
